<h1>Hello world!!!</h1>
<h2>Well come to my web site</h2>
    <h3> This is my web develompment tutorial</h3>
<p>This is the first file in my new Git Repo.</p>
<p>A new line in our file!</p>
<p> 
    With Git:
With a new branch called new-design, edit the code directly without impacting the main branch
EMERGENCY! There is an unrelated error somewhere else in the project that needs to be fixed ASAP!
Create a new branch from the main project called small-error-fix
Fix the unrelated error and merge the small-error-fix branch with the main branch
You go back to the new-design branch, and finish the work there
Merge the new-design branch with main (getting alerted to the small error fix that you were missing)
Branches allow you to work on different parts of a project without impacting the main branch.

When the work is complete, a branch can be merged with the main project.

You can even switch between branches and work on different projects without them interfering with each other.
